# Lightweight Image Gallery made by ChatGPT

I needed a very simple image gallery based on php and that it simply takes the images from an image directory. I asked ChatGPT to create some PHP code for me incl Boostrap 5, and this very light weight code is what the AI came up with. Enjoy! Yes, I'm a bit lazy sometimes to code PHP myself, this was much quicker :)
